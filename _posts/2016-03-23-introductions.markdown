Welcome! This is a new blog that gives me a place to write about the Rust
programming language. I have a variety of posts in the pipeline right now,
but I figured it'd be a good idea to start with something small, if for no
other reason than publishing a new blog with no posts is sad. So, here it is!
There should hopefully be new posts published soon.
