As of the writing of this post, this site is now on a proper domain name:
[suspectsemantics.com](http://www.suspectsemantics.com). I've had this domain
name for a good long while (years at this point), and I'm glad I've found a good
use for it. The transition to the new name went smoothly, and links to the
old GitHub Pages URL all appear to be redirecting correctly. If you have any
issues with the new site, let me know on the site's
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/andrewbrinker/andrewbrinker.github.io).
